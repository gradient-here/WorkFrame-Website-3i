# Product Redirect System

This document describes the product redirect system implementation for tracking attribution and analytics across the user journey from redirect ‚Üí product ‚Üí checkout ‚Üí purchase.

## System Overview

The simplified attribution system implements the following flow:

**Complete Purchase & Redirect Flow:**
```
Landing Page ‚Üí Buy Button Click ‚Üí Stripe Checkout ‚Üí Purchase Success ‚Üí Product Redirect
```

**Detailed Flow:**
```
1. User arrives on landing page (UTM tracking handled by analytics)
2. User clicks buy button ‚Üí Stripe URL enhanced with client_reference_id
3. User completes Stripe checkout ‚Üí client_reference_id stored in session
4. Stripe redirects to /api/purchase-redirect?session_id=cs_xxx
5. Server validates purchase & extracts product from client_reference_id
6. User redirected to their purchased product (ChatGPT/Notion)
```

**Product Destinations:**
- `quickread` ‚Üí https://chatgpt.com/g/g-689bf5fb269481918fccb4ffc7c32451-quickread
- `zettelkasten` ‚Üí https://www.notion.so/Zettelkasten-26de70b7724b8088870acb39d8538f9e?duplicate=true&from=stripe

## Testing the System

### 1. Start Development Server
```bash
pnpm dev
```

### 2. Test Basic Redirect (MVP)
Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/redirect?p=quickread
```

Expected result:
- HTTP 302 redirect to `https://chatgpt.com/g/g-689bf5fb269481918fccb4ffc7c32451-quickread`
- Attribution cookie set
- `redirect_to_product` event logged to PostHog

### 3. Test Redirect with User ID (Stretch Goal)
Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/redirect?p=quickread&u=user123
```

Expected result:
- HTTP 302 redirect to `https://chatgpt.com/g/g-689bf5fb269481918fccb4ffc7c32451-quickread`
- Attribution cookie set with user ID
- Event logged with user attribution

### 3b. Test Zettelkasten Product
Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/redirect?p=zettelkasten&u=user456
```

Expected result:
- HTTP 302 redirect to `https://www.notion.so/Zettelkasten-26de70b7724b8088870acb39d8538f9e?duplicate=true&from=stripe`
- Attribution cookie set with user ID
- Event logged for zettelkasten product

### 4. Test Error Handling
Try invalid requests:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/redirect
http://localhost:3000/api/redirect?p=invalid-product
http://localhost:3000/api/redirect?p=quickread&u=invalid<>user
```

Expected results:
- HTTP 400 responses with validation errors
- No redirects performed
- Error messages logged

### 5. Test Product Page Analytics
1. Visit `/products/quickread` directly
2. Visit via redirect link
3. Check browser console for tracking events
4. Look for "Special link detected" message when coming from redirect

### 6. Test Checkout Tracking
1. Visit `/products/quickread` via redirect
2. Click "Get QuickRead" or "Buy QuickRead" buttons
3. Check browser console for `checkout_started` events

### 7. Test Landing Page Attribution Flow

#### Test Landing Page Demo
1. Visit the demo landing page:
```
http://localhost:3000/landing-demo
```

2. Observe the session info that gets automatically generated
3. Click a buy button and check the console - you should see:
```
üîí Buy button clicked: {
  product: 'quickread',
  clientReferenceId: 'quickread_sess_1704067200000_abc123def_1704067300000',
  enhancedUrl: 'https://buy.stripe.com/aFa14m87e3xhdlx3wVfrW01?client_reference_id=quickread_sess_...' 
}
```

#### Test with UTM Parameters
Visit with UTM params to see tracking:
```
http://localhost:3000/landing-demo?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=quickread
```

#### Test Post-Purchase Redirect
Simulate a completed purchase:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/purchase-redirect?session_id=test-session-123
```

Expected result:
- Mock session includes `client_reference_id`: `quickread_sess_1704067200000_abc123def_1704067300000`
- Product extracted: `quickread`
- Session ID extracted for correlation: `sess_1704067200000_abc123def`
- `purchase_completed` event logged to PostHog
- HTTP 302 redirect to QuickRead ChatGPT

#### Full Flow
1. **Landing**: User arrives on landing page ‚Üí session generated, page view tracked
2. **Buy Click**: Click buy button ‚Üí Stripe URL enhanced, buy event tracked
3. **Checkout**: User completes Stripe payment ‚Üí `client_reference_id` preserved
4. **Success**: Stripe redirects to purchase-redirect endpoint
5. **Validation**: Server extracts product and session from `client_reference_id`
6. **Analytics**: Purchase completion logged with session correlation
7. **Product**: User redirected to their purchased product

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:

```bash
# PostHog Analytics (required for tracking)
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY=your_posthog_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com

# Stripe (for webhook signature verification - TODO)
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret

# Discord (existing functionality)
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_discord_webhook
```

## Stripe Dashboard Configuration

For the post-purchase redirect flow to work, you need to configure your existing Stripe Payment Links:

### Recommended: Update Payment Link Success URL
1. Go to your Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Payment Links
2. Edit your existing QuickRead payment link: `https://buy.stripe.com/6oUdR873ad7R2GTc3rfrW00`
3. Set the success URL to: `https://yourdomain.com/api/purchase-redirect?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}`
4. Users will be redirected to your product after purchase

**How it works:**
- Client-side JavaScript enhances Stripe URLs with `client_reference_id` parameter
- Attribution data is encoded in the `client_reference_id` (format: `product_userid_requestid_timestamp`)
- After payment, Stripe redirects to your success URL with the session ID
- Your backend retrieves the session from Stripe API to get the `client_reference_id`
- Attribution data is decoded and purchase completion is tracked
- User is redirected to their purchased product

### Webhook Configuration
1. In Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/api/stripe/webhook`
3. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`
4. Copy webhook signing secret to `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

## Features Implemented

### ‚úÖ Core Requirements Met
- **REQ-1.1.1 to REQ-1.1.5**: `/redirect` endpoint with validation and HTTP 302 redirects
- **REQ-1.2.1 to REQ-1.2.5**: Analytics tracking with PostHog, attribution cookies, request IDs
- **REQ-1.3.1 to REQ-1.3.5**: Stripe webhook handler structure (signature verification TODO)
- **REQ-2.1.1 to REQ-2.1.4**: Security measures including input sanitization and allowlists
- **REQ-2.2.2**: Asynchronous analytics logging to minimize redirect latency
- **REQ-3.1.1 to REQ-3.1.3**: Configurable product mapping
- **REQ-3.2.1 to REQ-3.2.5**: Complete analytics event schemas

### ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO Items
1. **Stripe Signature Verification**: Currently commented out in webhook handler
2. **Production Environment Variables**: Set up proper PostHog and Stripe keys
3. **Metadata Handling**: Client component can't export metadata (consider layout approach)
4. **Additional Product Pages**: Only QuickRead page updated so far

## System Architecture

### Complete User Journey

**Simplified Landing Page Flow:**
1. User arrives on landing page ‚Üí Session ID generated, UTM params captured
2. Page view tracked to PostHog with session data
3. User clicks buy button ‚Üí `buy_button_clicked` event logged
4. Stripe URL enhanced with `client_reference_id` (format: `product_sessionid_timestamp`)
5. User completes Stripe checkout ‚Üí `client_reference_id` stored in session
6. Stripe redirects to `/api/purchase-redirect?session_id=cs_xxx`
7. Server retrieves session from Stripe API and extracts product from `client_reference_id`
8. `purchase_completed` event logged with session correlation
9. User redirected to purchased product (ChatGPT/Notion) with access

### Analytics Events Schema
- `landing_page_view`: User arrived on landing page (with UTM data)
- `buy_button_clicked`: User clicked buy button (with enhanced Stripe URL)
- `purchase_completed`: Purchase completed via Stripe (with session correlation)

### Attribution Cookie Format
```json
{
  "p": "quickread",        // product slug
  "u": "user123",          // user ID (optional)
  "rid": "abc123def456",   // request ID for correlation
  "ts": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"  // timestamp
}
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### PostHog Events
Check your PostHog dashboard for these events:
- `redirect_to_product`
- `product_page_view` 
- `checkout_started`
- `purchase_completed`

### Browser Console
Client-side tracking logs appear in browser console:
```
Product page view tracked: { product: 'quickread', from_redirect: true, has_attribution: true }
Checkout started tracked: { product: 'quickread', checkout_url: '...', has_attribution: true }
```

### Server Logs
Check server console for:
- Redirect validation and processing
- Analytics event logging
- Error handling and warnings

## Security Notes

- Product destinations are allowlisted to prevent open redirects
- All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- Attribution cookies are httpOnly in production
- Request IDs prevent event correlation attacks
- Stripe webhook signatures should be verified (TODO)
